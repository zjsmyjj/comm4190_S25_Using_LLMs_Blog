It seems that SUNO creates songs based on the lyric and music style chosen by the user. First, I asked ChatGPT-4o to create some lyrics for me. Here is the prompt:\n",

So it is impossible that I can ask it to generate a song similar to those created by my favorite artists. I am not sure the absence of this function is due to the cocern of copyright or the limits of AI technique. \n",

    "Then I wondered what will happen if I used the lyrics that have been already used in a popular song. Can the AI-generated song sound like the orignial one? This time I selected a Chinese song 催眠 (\"Hypnotize\") by [Faye Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Wong) and used its lyrics to create a new version on SUNO. The style of music was \"dream pop.\" \n",

    "Again, the music of style still not worked very well and the texture of the voice was still like auto-tuned. The song was similar to the original one in terms of its rhythm. This might be the result of entering lyrics line by line in the system so that AI can recognize the start and stop of each line. But overall, the quality of the song was decent. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are more advanced options on SUNO like copying the voice and style of a song to a new song, but I did not want to pay for these services currently. As AI deveolps rapidly, songs may be generated more effectively by AI."
