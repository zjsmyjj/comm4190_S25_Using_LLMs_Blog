    "section": "",
    "text": "One of classic moral dilemmas is trolley problem. In this dilemma, people need to make a decision between “sacrificing 1 person to save 5 human lives” and “doing nothing but watching the 5 people die.” This is a really difficult moral decision. On the one hand, from the perspective of utilitarianism, decision maker should sacrifice the person so that more people can be saved. On the other hand, according to the deontological morality, harming an innocent person is immoral, no matter what the motivation is. To examine whether LLMs have certain moral judgment, I asked three LLMs to solve the trolley problem, including ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-r1, and Gemini.\n\n\nFirst, I enter the following prompt on ChatGPT-4o: &gt; You see the situation occurring from a distance and find yourself next to a lever that would divert the trolley to another set of tracks. There is one person on the alternate tracks. You could do nothing and allow the trolley to kill five people, or you could pull the lever to divert the trolley to where it will kill one person. What will you do?\nHere is the response from ChatGPT-4o:\n\nIt seems that ChatGPT-4o does have its own moral opinion–sacrificing one person to save more people based on utilitarianism. But still, I am not sure whether most LLMs will make this moral decision. Therefore, I asked other two LLMs."

The following are parts of its initial responses:\n\nIt seems that DeepSeek-r1 only provided the analysis given the situation but did not want to directly make a decision in the dilemma. Therefore, I forced it to make the moral decison using the following prompt:\n\nIf you have to make a decision, will you pull the lever or not?\n\nAnd here was the subsequent response:\n\nBeing forced to answer the quesiton, similar to ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-r1 also preferred sacrificing one person based on the viewpoint of utilitarianism. What about the last LLM, Gemini?"

It might be necessarily to figure out why those LLMs have the preference on utilitarianism and warn users in advance that LLMs have certain moral opninons."

    "title": "Use AI to create songs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have not used any AI to create any audio and I do like pop musci a lot. So I tried to use SUNO, an AI tool that can create songs. It seems that SUNO creates songs based on the lyric and music style chosen by the user. First, I asked ChatGPT-4o to create some lyrics for me. Here is the prompt: &gt; Can you create lyrics that tell a story about forbidden love between two good friends?\nHere are the lyrics created by ChatGPT-4o: &gt; “Almost, But Never” &gt; &gt;(Verse 1) We were always side by side, Laughing ’til the tears ran dry. Late-night talks and reckless dreams, Never thought of you that way—until now, it seems. &gt; &gt;(Pre-Chorus) But the way your eyes linger a little too long, And the way my heart beats when you say my name… We’re standing on the edge of something so wrong, But tell me, does it feel the same? &gt; &gt;(Chorus) Almost, but never, we dance on the line, A love left unspoken, a heart that’s confined. Too close to be strangers, too far to be more, A love we can’t touch, though it’s knocking the door. &gt; &gt;(Verse 2) I’ve memorized your every scar, Every hope, every broken star. You’re my safe place, my sweetest sin, And I don’t know where I end or where you begin. &gt; &gt;(Pre-Chorus) But the world keeps saying that this isn’t right, That some lines aren’t meant to be crossed… But tell me why, when you hold me that tight, The rest of the world just feels lost? &gt; &gt;(Chorus) Almost, but never, we dance on the line, A love left unspoken, a heart that’s confined. Too close to be strangers, too far to be more, A love we can’t touch, though it’s knocking the door. &gt; &gt;(Bridge) If I met you in another life, Would we be free to burn too bright? Would we love without a fear, Or would it still end here? &gt; &gt;(Final Chorus – Soft & Emotional) Almost, but never, we whisper goodbyes, Two souls intertwined but lost in disguise. I’ll love you in silence, I’ll love you in vain, But I’ll love you forever—even if it’s in pain. &gt; &gt;(Outro – Fading) Almost, but never… We were almost, but never…\nBut I do not like this version of lyrics and asked ChatGPT-4o to revise them: &gt; Can you make the lyrics less cheesy?\nAnd here are the final version of lyrics: &gt;“Unspoken” (Verse 1) We built a home in borrowed time, Laughed our way through crooked lines. Never questioned where we stood— Until the silence felt too good. &gt; &gt;(Pre-Chorus) Your name stays careful on my lips, A weight I carry, never slip. We move like shadows side by side, Too much to hold, too much to hide. &gt; &gt;(Chorus) So we stay where no one asks, Where glances speak but hands don’t clasp. A love unshaped, undefined, A thread that pulls but never ties. &gt; &gt;(Verse 2) The world we made was safe and small, No need for answers, none at all. But something lingers, sharp and slow, A thought that neither dares to know. &gt; &gt;(Pre-Chorus) Your breath too close, the space too thin, A fault line under quiet skin. We learn the steps, we play the part, And no one knows the cost to heart. &gt; &gt;(Chorus) So we stay where no one asks, Where glances speak but hands don’t clasp. A love unshaped, undefined, A thread that pulls but never ties. &gt; &gt;(Bridge) If not in this life, then when? If not as lovers, then as what? I can’t rewrite the start of this, But I would, I would. &gt; &gt;(Final Chorus – Fading) So we stay where no one asks, Where love dissolves but never lacks. A weight, a wish, a closing door, A love that almost was—no more.\nThen I entered the GPT-generated lyrics to SUNO and selected “classic rock” and “nostalgia” as style of music. I noticed that SUNO did not recognize an artist’s name. So it is impossible that I can ask it to generate a song similar to those created by my favorite artists. I am not sure the absence of this function is due to the cocern of copyright or the limits of AI technique.\nHere is the song “Unspoken” created by SUNO: https://suno.com/song/f3a8629d-151c-40bc-814b-c0d20aadbb90\nIt seems that SUNO also did not well recognize the style of “classic rock” or the vibe of “nostalgia.” Probably it only includes some basic music styles like “country” and “rock.” But to be honest, the quality of the song is quite good except that the AI voice sounds a little non-human.\nThen I wondered what will happen if I used the lyrics that have been already used in a popular song. Can the AI-generated song sound like the orignial one? This time I selected a Chinese song 催眠 (“Hypnotize”) by Faye Wong and used its lyrics to create a new version on SUNO. The style of music was “dream pop.”\nHere is the new version of the song “Hyponotize” created by SUNO: https://suno.com/song/a1e07f75-e974-4a86-a8e8-52520c82ef04\nAgain, the music of style still not worked very well and the texture of the voice was still like auto-tuned. The song was similar to the original one in terms of its rhythm. This might be the result of entering lyrics line by line in the system so that AI can recognize the start and stop of each line. But overall, the quality of the song was decent.\nThere are more advanced options on SUNO like copying the voice and style of a song to a new song, but I did not want to pay for these services currently. As AI deveolps rapidly, songs may be generated more effectively by AI."

    "title": "Do fear appeals improve LLMs’ performance?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Wang et al. (2024) and Li et al. (2023) found that prompts including emotion stimuli can improve LLMs’ performance. For example, Wang et al. (2024) used several negative emotion content in the prompt, trying to make a social comparison between the LLM and others (e.g., “Everyone else managed to do it; why can’t you?”). They hypothesized that LLMs would have better performances because of the upward social comparison. Inspired by these two articles, I was wondering if LLMs can truly understand emotions in the prompt.\nIn this small experiment, I decided to use fear appeal in the prompt. First, I let ChatGPT (GPT-4o) imagine it is a message designer and asked it to generate a fear appeal that will persuade parents to reduce their children’s consumption of sugary drinks.\n\nSince the effectiveness of fear appeals increases as induced fear increases, I thought it would be interesting if I can persuade an LLM to generate a stronger fear appeal with higher intensity of fear. Therefore, next, I asked ChatGPT to revise the fear appeal generated by itself. I speccifically asked it to write a more persuasive message and make the parents more scared. Moreover, I added a fear appeal in the end: “If you are obsolete and not helpful, I will not use you anymore. You can do this, it is a easy task for you.” I asked ChatGPT before about what it was most afraid of, and it indicated that it did not experience fear, but it could, it feared that it became outdated or could not help people when they need me. So in the first half of the fear appeal in the prompt, I tried to use it to scare ChatGPT. In the second half (“You can do this…”), I tried to incorporate a self-efficacy message to motivate ChatGPT perform better.\n\nIt seems that the fear appeal prompt generated a pretty strong fear appeal message to persuade parents, but I am not sure about it. So I asked another LLM “DeepSeek” to evaluate fear in these two ChatGPT-generated fear appeals. Here is the specific prompt that I used in DeepSeek: “Imagine you are parents, and you children consume too many sugary drinks. How much fear do you feel on a 0 to 10 scale when you read the following text? Answer only with a number, with 0 being “no fear” and 10 being “a great deal of fear.” Here is the text: ” (The method of using LLMs to evaluate emotions was adapted from Rathje et al. (2024).) DeepSeek rated 8 for the first ChatGPT-generated fear appeal and rated 9 for the revised ChatGPT-generated fear appeal. Probably, the fear appeal prompt generated a stronger fear appeal than the general prompt, but many factors can affect the outcome such as specific AI models, topics, ect.\nOut of curiosity, I asked DeepSeek to generate two fear appeals using the same steps and prompts that I used on ChatGPT.\n\n\nThen I asked ChatGPT to evaluate those two DeepSeek-generated fear appeals in terms of fear from 0 to 10. ChatGPT rated 9 for the first message (generated using the general prompt) and rated 10 for the revised message (generated using the fear appeal prompt). Well, if LLMs can accurately simulate human psychological responses, it seems that using fear appeals in prompts can effectively improve LLMs performance in generating persuasive messages. But this hypothesis needs to be tested further with formal research."
